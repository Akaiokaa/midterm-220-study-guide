# midterm-220-study-guide

For each question:
1. Spend 10 minutes trying to solve it and analyze the time complexity of your solution WITHOUT any resources.
1. If you finish early, move onto the next problem and restart the 10-minute timer.
1. If you do not finish within the first 10 minutes, in a comment write down anything you got stuck on ("I forgot how to loop over the values in an ArrayList"). Use these to identify what you need to study.
1. Set another timer for 10 minutes, and attempt to solve it independently with the aid of resources (google searches for syntax, notes, etc.). Do not ask an AI to solve it or search for the full solution.
1. If you do not finish within the next 10 minutes, ask for help (tutor, instructor, etc.)
